# Connect 4

A simple Connect 4 game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. Two players take turns dropping their colored pieces (red and yellow) onto a 6x7 grid. The first player to connect four of their pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- numpy

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.x from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install Pygame and numpy using pip:

```
pip install pygame numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file.

2. Run the script:

```
python main.py
```

3. The game window will open. Two players can now take turns dropping their pieces into the grid by clicking on the desired column with the mouse.

4. When a player connects four pieces in a row, the game will display a message indicating the winner and pause for a few seconds before automatically closing.

5. To quit the game at any time, close the game window.
